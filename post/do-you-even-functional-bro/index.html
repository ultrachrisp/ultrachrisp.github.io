My interest grew from a side conversation I over-heard. After that, every taste taught me something different. There is something truly haunting about functional programming.<br><br>I have completed <a href="https://www.coursera.org/account/accomplishments/specialization/3VS6JECTTJKS" title="Functional Programming in Scala">Functional Programming in Scala</a>. I was not fully prepared for the learning curve as many of the concepts and principles were new to me. What I took away from the course has had a real impact on the way I approach software development.</p>

<h2 id="the-discussion">The discussion</h2>

<p>Of course there is debate, we are spoiled for choice. There are three classic schools: imperative, procedural & functional. They all have their strengths. I have used imperative more than procedural. So when tasked with converting your general approach and thoughts regarding programming, a lot depends on the context. Concession make sense as stated by in <a href="Https:https://medium.com/@bfil/just-enough-functional-programming-a0c4fd09c8f7" title="Just enough functional programming">Just enough functional programming</a>. You then also get the other view in <a href="https://www.vincit.fi/en/blog/empty-promises-and-other-heresy/" title="Empty promises and heresy">Empty promises and heresy</a>.</p>

<p>Being fully emerged in a functional environment enables deeper insights but needs to be part of your daily life. At the time, I had yet to integrate a fully functional approach into my daily tasks.</p>

<h3 id="is-that-you-js">Is that you JS?</h3>

<p>My first love was <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ActionScript" title="ActionScript">ActionScript</a>. I still miss features of the language. There was even a time I used ActionScript & JavaScript in tandem, the two <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ECMAScript" title="ECMAScript">ECMAScript</a> twins. I hurt when they fought and I was sad to see ActionScript leave... I resented JavaScript. This changed with time as I learned that it was not JavaScript that I was resenting but rather the contemporary practises. In time, I witnessed JavaScript adapt and morph into what we see today.</p>

<p>In many ways, I am grateful that the web has iterated so rapidly enabling an environment for <a href="https://facebook.github.io/react/" title="React">React</a>. I felt joy when I realised 'how' React was solving many of my more common struggles.</p>

<h3 id="react-lands">React lands</h3>

<p>So after a fairly in depth introduction to functional I was presented with a problem that I wanted to solve with my new found knowledge. At the same time I started reading about <a href="https://facebook.github.io/react/" title="ReactJS">ReactJS</a>, and that is when I really became excited.</p>

<p>I do not think that I would have had the same reaction about React if I had not actively been looking for a functional solution to a rich, interactive, static web components. I raced through <a href="https://www.udemy.com/react-redux/" title="Modern React with redux">Modern React with redux</a> and was thrilled when I realised that it was actively supporting a functional approach. <a href="https://lodash.com/" title="Lodash">Lodash</a> integrated seamlessly and it was easy enough to extend with other libraries that I needed.</p>

<p>I knew I was getting serious about React when I integrated <a href="https://github.com/felipeochoa/rjsx-mode" title="rjsx-mode">rjsx-mode</a>, with a couple of personal tweaks, into my standard Emacs build. Aside from a few issues I could not immediately solve with what was there and supported, I dived into this exciting new world of functional front-end.</p>
