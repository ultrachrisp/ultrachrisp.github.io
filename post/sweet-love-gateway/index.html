Ephemeropolis was my first burn. I got involved with the AfrikaBurn website build in 2010 but never made it to a burn until now. Attending has long been on the to-do list, so we started making plans late 2018. The core build team included <a href="https://www.facebook.com/igor.zeljko.77">Igor</a>, <a href="https://www.facebook.com/alastair.mehl">Alastair</a>, <a href="https://www.facebook.com/magoshashot">Margaret</a>, <a href="https://www.facebook.com/tiffanychi101">Tiffany</a> and myself. Supporting the team was <a href="https://www.facebook.com/CyBeRmAnZA">Bjorn</a> as well as the members of the &#39;NoFomosapiens&#39;. The build teams at Oppikoppi and Meilie-pop were bigger but many members couldn&#39;t attend AfrikaBurn. Contributing to AfrikaBurn seemed natural since we had build structures at festivals before.<br><br>
The project took the form of a <a href="https://www.mathcurve.com/surfaces.gb/paraboloidhyperbolic/paraboloidhyperbolic.shtml">hyperbolic paraboloid</a> (look at my fancy vocabulary) gateway. Igor, Alastair and Margaret had built this structure before at Oppikoppi. Based off of their insights, I thought there was room to refine &#39;how&#39; it was build. I also took on the responsibility of lighting the structure.
</p>
<h2 id="headline-1">
The Problem Statement
</h2>
<p>
The structure itself seems simple enough. A square comprised of four square lashings at each corner. The hyperbolic paraboloid is created when you warp the 2D square into a 3D space. There is an interesting by-product of the shape: the surface or mesh bends to accommodate the frame, but the individual threads remain straight. Some of the first problems to solve were:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>
How to secure the individual threads to the poles?
</p>
</li>

<p>
What is the optimal spacing between the threads to create a dense enough weave to catch the LED light?
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Possible ways to achieve the above without over working the build team?
</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>
The first few times the structure was built, the spacing between the threads was large. Too large to catch the light. The threads where also tied to the poles individually, making the weaving labour intensive. First, each thread needed to be tied into place. When the structure was hoisted into its final shape, each thread need to be tightened. Unsurprisingly, the team agreed that there was room to improve here.
</p>
<p>
My programming self needed a way to speed up the thread anchoring and weaving. There had to be a way to for-loop / while-loop / map over the threads.

This is one of those skills that matures like a fine wine. When I was young, brute force and enthusiasm would carry me through most projects. With time, I realised that I was making similar mistakes at similar stages of a project. Worse, avoidable mistakes were made because all stakeholders were not consulted. The process of finding and fixing issues doesn&#39;t go away, it&#39;s &#39;when&#39; you fix them that prototyping can help with.<br><br>
 Prototyping for pioneering projects was always a given. As a scout (aka young hot-shot who builds first and explains later, dealing with and fixing issues as they arise), prototyping was what the scout master told you to do. This resulted in a small version of the real version, which was great for photo opportunities (small version in foreground, big version in background). We did attempt to measure the poles to scale, but the true value of prototyping was lost to us.<br><br>
 As I have mentioned in a <a href="https://chrispyke.com/post/almighty-prototype/">previous post</a>, prototypes are my sandbox. It&#39;s a space where I can play and make mistakes before they result in serious consequences. 
</p>
<h3 id="headline-3">
Iteration
</h3>
<p>
I set about trying different approaches. The first prototype was concerned with the basic shape.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>
Could the hyperbolic paraboloid be hoisted into position from a flat 2D square? 
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Would the shape appear if we had two flat, perpendicular surfaces that weren&#39;t woven into one another? 
</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>
As much as a small scale prototype could, it confirmed the above was possible. The structure would not be as secure as if the two planes were woven into one another. But the time spent weaving would be reduced. It would also allow us to tighten threads without the threads knotting in the weave. There were obvious problems with this prototype, but it served its purpose and was super quick to make.
</p>
<p>
The next problem regarded the thread and the weave. Prototype two and three would focused around solving the following:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>
How could we anchor the thread on the pole so that we could weave and tighten multiple threads at once?
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Was there a possibility of weaving more than a single, long thread at a time?
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Could we access the anchor points from the ground, once the structure was getting close to its final shape?
</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>

We started investigating different types of anchorage on the poles. What was the cost of an anchor and how long would it take to secure it to the poles? <br><br>
 One solution proposed by Igor or Tiffany (or both) was to use metal chains. If the chain was secured onto the pole, it provided a ton of anchorage points. This was better than hooks or eye-hole bolts which required individual attention. It wasn&#39;t a perfect solution, but it did provide the best &#39;number of anchor points per cost&#39; ratio.
</p>
<p>
The actual method of weaving the thread through the chains was the next major problem. After an afternoon of weaving, prototype two proved that simply feeding the thread through the chain was not good enough. It was impractical because of the volume of threads as well as possible confusion caused by different weaving styles. Igor suggested a different approach, feeding the incoming end of the thread through a single chain link, running the thread along the chain and then feed the out-going end through a link further along. This made tightening threads clearer as it was immediately evident which thread needed pulling vs feeding. Again, there is a programming term for this: clear and descriptive variable names.
</p>
<p>
With these two pivotal issues solved in theory, I focused on some of the finer construction issues. The surface area of the hyperbolic paraboloid is smaller than a flat square. If you can get the building shape close to the final shape, you can reduce the amount of wasted thread. This meant hoisting two corners up on barrels at the very start, as well as moving in the base poles. Additionally, you didn&#39;t need access to all the anchor points while tightening the weave, only half of them. In theory, you could keep one half of the structure on the ground and hoist the other half into the air. We could do this iteratively and shouldn&#39;t need extra scaffolding to secure the structure in the air.
</p>
<p>
Armed with these insights, I felt confident that we could erect the structure on the day.
</p>

Individually Addressable Awesomeness

<p>
I had an idea of &#39;how&#39; I wanted to illuminate the structure, but I was exploring new ground. It culminated into my first adventure into micro-controllers. I was wholly unprepared for the end result.

It started with crawling the internet, inspecting tutorials, looking at specs, looking at prices, then re-looking at specs and prices. I tried to factor redundancy into the system. Often, I would restart the process when I found more promising solutions.
</p>
<p>
The first problem to solve was power. After checking availability and cost, we settled on a battery of car batteries (five to be exact). Bjorn sourced the car batteries and solar panels to charge them. At the time, we were unsure how much power the LED strips required? So we got more car batteries to be safe.
</p>
<p>
As for the LED strips, I was able to source some WS2813 strips (upgraded WS2812b). They were each 5 meter long, with 60 LEDs per meter. Each strip had 300 individually addressable LEDs. This had a potential power draw of 100w per strip (if each LED was burning at full brightness on white light). The structure comprised of four 11 meter poles, so we had roughly 40m that we needed to cover with LEDs. That is 2400 individually addressable LEDs… I was starting to get very excited.

The LED strips ran on 5v, which was very handy. We needed step-down converters to get from 20v to 5v to run the strips and micro-controllers. I was able to get an idea of the processing power required to run that number of LEDs from <a href="https://github.com/FastLED/FastLED/issues/288">this thread</a>. To ensure that I wasn&#39;t overworking the controllers, I decided to dedicate an Arduino DUE for each pole.<br><br>
 The next problem to solve was interaction. I sourced two lasers that produced line beams and 6 photo-resistors to produce a &#39;trip wire&#39; system. I then setup a Raspberry Pi 3b to receive signals from the photo-resistors. The Rasberry Pi also co-ordinate lighting effects with the Arduinos. As I worked on the system, I realised it could be simplified by favoring WIFI over cabling. I replaced the Arduino Duos with ESP32 controllers. This enabled more streamlined communication between Pi and controller using the <a href="http://mqtt.org/">MQTT protocol</a>. The theory was sound enough and I got a working version running in my garage.
</p>
<p>
Time caught up with me in the end. I did as many general tests as I could before packing up the system and preparing for the trip to Tankwa Town.

The group that I was traveling with needed two full days to get from Johannesburg to Tankwa. We were venturing into the unknown (i.e. none of us had been to AfrikaBurn before), so there was a fair amount of over-preparation.<br><br>
 The first hurdle was separating the essential equipment from the &#39;nice to haves&#39;. The second was to get everyone in the group into a car, and get the group moving. One of the car&#39;s blew a tyre before we even left the good highways or started driving on gravel roads. We dealt with all of this in turn, trying to balance the group&#39;s feelings with the common objectives.<br><br>
 Once we got to Tankwa town and setup our tents, we went in search of our 11 meter poles. We found them stacked by the Clan&#39;s Lamp (the core AfrikaBurn structure). The Clan helped us purchase and transported the poles to Tankwa town. This greatly simplified our lives and we were very grateful to the Clan for their help. After locating the poles, we left transporting them to the build site for the next morning.
</p>
<p>
Three of the 11 meter poles were missing when we awoke. Everyone, including the organisers, were stunned. Search parties were sent out, calls were made and the whole camp started looking for the missing poles. They were eventually spotted by Igor at another build site. We got help transporting them to our build site and then started construction. The team&#39;s moral took a hit.
</p>
<p>
When we started securing the chains to the poles, one of the poles snapped. There were many possible reasons why it could have snapped (the wood was untreated by choice, the poles were left out in the desert for too long, rough treatment by the pole thieves). But none of this helped to solved the problem.
</p>
<p>
We had two options before us: try to fix/ brace the broken pole with metal (causing further delays) or literal cut our losses by shortening all the poles to match the broken one. There was debate, but the group decided to cut the poles and carry on building. There was a small consolation that all the poles were actually 12 meters long instead of 11. This meant that we didn&#39;t reduce the size of the structure as much as we initially feared. Regardless, moral took another hit.

Weaving nearly broke the team. Based on the prototypes, the team knew that weaving was the hardest part and took the most time. We had over-come more obstacles than anticipated just to get to this point. The team carried themselves very well through the roughly 18 hours of straight weaving. They even continued weaving through a dust storm.<br><br>
 Hoisting the structure was the last hurdle for the core build team. We were caught off guard with the realities of AfrikaBurn. After two and a half days of construction and weaving, we needed to stop and hold the structure in a precarious position overnight. This slammed moral even further, but it provided a much needed rest. 
</p>
<p>
The next morning, we got some unexpected assistance from the Clan cherry picker. This helped speed up the final stage of the project. We leaned the gateway into its final position and celebrated what we had done. But even though the structure was up, I still needed to finish setting up the lights.
</p>
<p>
In the end, the photo-resistors, lasers as well as my beginner welding skills did not like the dust. After a couple of hours of failed trouble-shooting, I decided to abandon the interactive part of the lighting. Plan B was to cycle through a couple of predefined lighting effects.
</p>
<p>
The end result was still impressive. We received a lot of great feedback from everyone who saw the gateway. It was rewarding to watch peoples reactions as they walked through, running their fingers along the weave.
</p>
<p>
I still consider the project a success, even though we didn&#39;t end up exactly as planned. There were many unexpected hurdles we overcame just to get the gateway up. And the whole exercise gave me an excuse play with new technologies and concepts.

It is very hard for me to sum up AfrikaBurn: Ephemeropolis. This post has only focused on the Sweet Love Gateway, but there was so, so very much more. I was invited to present &amp; share my experiences, so I created this <a href="https://slides.com/ultrachrisp/deck">slide deck</a>.

AfrikaBurn changed me. It changed me for the better. The people, the projects, the setting… I still struggle to find words to describe it. But if I had to try, it would probably go with something like:
